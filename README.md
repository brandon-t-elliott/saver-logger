# 🔐 SAVER_LOGGER - Burp Suite Extension

**Author:** Sachhit Anasane  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 2025  

---

## 🧭 Overview

SAVER_LOGGER is a professionally engineered extension for Burp Suite that automatically logs all HTTP requests across tools like Proxy, Scanner, Repeater, Intruder, Collaborator, and Dashboard. It captures comprehensive request metadata including insertion points, request timing, status codes, and tool sources—then exports structured CSV logs with complete audit trails.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: Captures every HTTP request from all Burp tools
- ✅ **Complete Metadata**: Host, method, URL, status code, tool source, insertion points, and timing
- ✅ **Insertion Point Detection**: Counts the HTTP parameters in each request (URL, body, and cookie parameters) as potential insertion points, uniformly for all tools
- ✅ **Request Counting**: Tracks how many times each URL has been accessed
- ✅ **Timing Analysis**: Records a start timestamp when each request is seen and an end timestamp when its response arrives

### Export & Backup
- ✅ **Auto-backup on Exit**: Crash-safe backup with timestamped filename (`SAVER_LOGGER_AUTOSAVE_DDMMYYYY_HHMMSS.csv`)
- ✅ **Periodic Auto-backup**: Configurable interval (10-3600 seconds) to custom folder
- ✅ **Manual Export**: User-triggered CSV export with file chooser dialog
- ✅ **Manual Backup**: Instant timestamped backup (`SAVER_LOGGER_BACKUP_DDMMYYYY_HHMMSS.csv`)
- ✅ **Single File Approach**: Periodic backups overwrite same file to prevent fragmentation

### Data Integrity
- ✅ **UTF-8 Encoding**: Full international character support
- ✅ **CSV Sanitization**: Automatic handling of commas, newlines, and special characters
- ✅ **Footer Metadata**: Burp version, export timestamp, and unique runtime ID
- ✅ **Session Tracking**: Unique session identifier for audit trails

### User Interface
- ✅ **Dashboard Tab**: Quick access to export, backup, and clear functions
- ✅ **Settings Tab**: Configure backup folder, interval, and enable/disable auto-backup
- ✅ **Status Area**: Real-time logging of all operations with timestamps
- ✅ **Confirmation Dialogs**: User-friendly feedback for all actions

   https://www.jython.org/download.html
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Burp Suite
1. Open Burp Suite

## 🛠️ Usage Instructions

### Basic Operation
1. **Automatic Logging**: All HTTP traffic is logged automatically once the extension is loaded
2. **Access Dashboard**: Click the **SAVER_LOGGER** tab to view controls and info
3. **Configure Settings**: Navigate to the **Settings** tab to customize backup behavior

### Dashboard Actions

#### Export CSV
- Opens file chooser dialog
- Allows custom filename and location
- Default name: `SAVER_LOGGER_Export_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
- Exports all logged requests with complete metadata

#### Backup Now
- Creates instant timestamped backup
- Saves to configured backup folder
- Filename: `SAVER_LOGGER_BACKUP_DDMMYYYY_HHMMSS.csv`
- Shows confirmation with file path

#### Clear Logs
- Removes all logged requests from memory
- Requires user confirmation
- Does not delete previously exported files

### Settings Configuration

#### Auto-Backup Settings
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle automatic periodic backups
- **Backup Interval**: Set time between auto-backups (10-3600 seconds)
- **Backup Folder**: Choose custom directory for backups
- **Default Location**: Desktop

#### How Auto-Backup Works
- **Periodic Backup**: Overwrites `SAVER_LOGGER_AUTOSAVE.csv` at configured interval
- **Exit Backup**: Creates timestamped file on Burp close/crash
- **Single File**: Prevents file proliferation during normal operation

### File Naming Conventions

| Backup Type | Filename Pattern | Example |
|-------------|------------------|---------|
| Periodic Auto-backup | `SAVER_LOGGER_AUTOSAVE.csv` | `SAVER_LOGGER_AUTOSAVE.csv` |
| Exit/Crash Backup | `SAVER_LOGGER_AUTOSAVE_DDMMYYYY_HHMMSS.csv` | `SAVER_LOGGER_AUTOSAVE_24122025_143052.csv` |
| Manual Backup | `SAVER_LOGGER_BACKUP_DDMMYYYY_HHMMSS.csv` | `SAVER_LOGGER_BACKUP_24122025_143052.csv` |
| Manual Export | `SAVER_LOGGER_Export_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` | `SAVER_LOGGER_Export_20251224_143052.csv` |

## 📄 CSV Export Format

### Column Structure

All exported CSV files contain the following 10 columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Serial No** | Sequential request identifier (1, 2, 3...) |
| **Host** | Target hostname or IP address |
| **Request Method** | HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) |
| **URL** | Complete request URL including query parameters |
| **Status Code** | HTTP response status code (200, 404, 500, etc.); `-` while awaiting the response, and `Error` if the response cannot be parsed |
| **Tool Name** | Burp tool that generated the request (Proxy, Scanner, Repeater, Intruder) |
| **Request Count** | Number of times this specific URL has been requested |
| **Insertion Point Count** | Number of insertion points/parameters detected |
| **Start Time** | Request initiation timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) |
| **End Time** | Response received timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS); `-` while awaiting the response |

> **When rows are logged:** each request is logged as its own row the moment
> it is seen, so every request is recorded even if no response ever arrives.
> Until the matching response is received, the **Status Code** and **End Time**
> columns show `-`; they are filled in on that same row when the response
> arrives. (A response with no matching request is logged as its own row.)

### Insertion Point Detection Logic

For every tool, the extension counts the HTTP parameters present in the
request (URL, body, and cookie parameters) as potential insertion points.

### Header Metadata

Every CSV file includes:
```
# Generated By: SAVER_LOGGER
# Session ID: 20251224143052
# Export Time: 2025-12-24 14:30:52
# Total Requests: 1547
```

### Footer Metadata

Every CSV file concludes with:
```
